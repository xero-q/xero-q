Hi, I'm Anibal :disguised_face:

I'm a Software Engineer with more than 10 years of experience. I have worked mainly with: Python, .NET, Javascript/Typescript, PHP and Java. I also have experience with Machine Learning. Currently I aspire to become a Senior Pythonist and ML Engineer :star_struck:, using also Angular and React for the frontend. Fond of Linux (particularly Ubuntu/Kubuntu) and AI/ML.
