Hi, I'm Anibal :disguised_face:

I'm a Software Engineer with more than 10 years of experience. I have worked mainly with: PHP, .NET, Javascript/Typescript and Python. Currently I aspire to become a Senior Pythonist :star_struck:, using also Angular for the frontend. Fond of Linux (particularly Ubuntu/Kubuntu).
